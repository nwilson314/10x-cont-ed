## Summary

This revised **10× Self-Directed CS Curriculum** comprises nine core modules plus a parallel **LLM & AI Systems Track**, each focused on building a standalone project that naturally feeds into the next module’s work. You’ll start by coding a **CPU simulator** to understand microarchitecture, then leverage it to visualize algorithm performance in your **algorithm explorer**, progress to a **matrix library** that powers your **neural network trainer**, and so on—culminating in a distributed, fault-tolerant service and a mini‐LLM. Each module’s project is chosen to reinforce its concepts and provide a tangible artifact, while the chaining of artifacts fosters continuity and deeper integration across the curriculum.

---

## 1. Computer Architecture

**Project:** **Pipeline-And-Cache CPU Simulator**
**Goals:**

* Implement a fetch-decode-execute loop with RISC-V–style instructions ([EUDL][1]).
* Add a 5-stage pipeline with data/control hazard detection and forwarding ([ResearchGate][2]).
* Simulate an L1 cache (configurable associativity, block size) and measure hit/miss rates ([EUDL][1]).

---

## 2. Algorithms & Data Structures

**Project:** **Interactive Algorithm Explorer**
**Goals:**

* Use the CPU simulator from Module 1 to gather cycle counts for sorting and graph algorithms ([Reddit][3]).
* Implement and visualize core structures: dynamic arrays, heaps, red-black trees, and hash tables ([Mimoza][4]).
* Animate Dijkstra’s and A\* pathfinding with performance overlays.

---

## 3. Math for CS/ML

**Project:** **Matrix & Probability Toolkit**
**Goals:**

* Build a linear algebra library supporting vector/matrix operations and LU decomposition ([NMSU Computer Science][5]).
* Implement discrete probability simulations (e.g., Markov chains, random graphs) and plot distributions ([Stack Overflow][6]).
* Expose APIs for downstream use in ML models and graph-algorithm benchmarks.

---

## 4. Operating Systems

**Project:** **User-Level Thread Library & Mini-Kernel**
**Goals:**

* Create a thread library with preemptive scheduling and synchronization primitives ([MIT OpenCourseWare][7]).
* Extend the CPU simulator to load “processes” and handle context switches.
* Implement a simple file-system interface and memory-mapped I/O.

---

## 5. Computer Networking

**Project:** **Custom TCP/IP Stack & Chat App**
**Goals:**

* Build raw socket handlers for IP, ARP, ICMP, and TCP state machines ([CS 144][8]).
* Use your mini-kernel from Module 4 to host a UDP-based chat application with reliability features ([GitHub][9]).
* Measure throughput and latency under simulated packet loss.

---

## 6. Web Development & Browser Architecture

**Project:** **Micro-Browser Engine**
**Goals:**

* Parse HTTP responses and integrate with your TCP/IP stack from Module 5 ([Limpet][10]).
* Implement HTML/CSS parsing, build DOM/CSSOM, and render a box model visualization ([GeeksforGeeks][11]).
* Add a JavaScript sandbox for basic DOM manipulation and service-worker caching.

---

## 7. Databases

**Project:** **Build-Your-Own Key-Value Store**
**Goals:**

* Create a write-ahead log and LSM-tree storage engine in Go or your language of choice ([build-your-own.org][12]).
* Integrate with your mini-kernel’s file interface from Module 4 for persistence ([Reddit][13]).
* Expose a simple HTTP REST API using your micro-browser framework for CRUD operations.

---

## 8. Compilers & Interpreters

**Project:** **Toy Language Compiler**
**Goals:**

* Implement a lexer and recursive-descent parser to produce an AST for a small statically typed language ([craftinginterpreters.com][14]).
* Generate bytecode targeting your CPU simulator from Module 1, with basic optimizations (constant folding) ([CodeCrafters][15]).
* Build a REPL that runs on your micro-browser’s JS sandbox for interactive testing.

---

## 9. Distributed Systems

**Project:** **Sharded Raft-Based KV Service**
**Goals:**

* Use your key-value store (Module 7) to implement a Raft consensus cluster for replication ([GitHub][16]).
* Add dynamic sharding via a configuration service and client-side routing.
* Benchmark consistency, latency, and fault-tolerance under node failures and network partitions.

---

## 10. LLM & AI Systems Track (Parallel)

**Project:** **Mini-LLM from Scratch**
**Goals:**

* Implement tokenization, positional encoding, and scaled dot-product attention modules ([Spheron Blog][17]).
* Train a small transformer on project-generated logs (e.g., CPU simulator traces) using PyTorch.
* Build a simple chat interface served over your micro-browser for interactive querying.

By constructing each module’s project upon the previous one’s artifact, this curriculum ensures continuous integration of concepts and tools—locking in both theory and practice on your journey to becoming a **10× engineer**.
